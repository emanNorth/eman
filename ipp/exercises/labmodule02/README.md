# Programming in Python - An Introduction: Lab Module 02

### Description

Briefly describe the objectives of the Lab Module:

1) Practice using Python numeric data types including integers and floats numbers. 

2) Practice using simple calculations and type conversions. 

3) Work with strings, booleans, and sequence operations such as lists, tuples, and ranges.


### Exercise Activities

List the actions you took in implementing the Lab Module:

1) Created multiple Python modules to demonstrate numeric types, calculations, formatted strings, booleans, and sequences.

2) Implemented test cases in each module following the Lab 02 exercise instructions posted

3) Executed each module using the IDE and command line to verify correct output.


### Unit and/or Integration Tests Executed

List the tests you exercised in validating your functionality for the Lab Module:

1) Ran `SimpleNumerics.py` and confirmed correct arithmetic results and type conversions.

2) Ran `SimpleNumericCalcs.py` and confirmed arithmetic and remainder calculations.

3) Ran `SimpleFormattedStrings.py`, `SimpleBooleans.py`, and `SimpleSequences.py` to confirm formatted strings, boolean outputs, and sequence manipulations.
