# Programming in Python - An Introduction: Lab Module 01

### Description

Briefly describe the objectives of the Lab Module:

1) Set up the Python development environment, including Python installation, configuring the IDE.

2) Establish a task management workflow, including cloning the repository and setting up Git.

3) Verify Python and module functionality by running tests scripts to ensure sys, platform and string exercises work correctly. 


### Exercise Activities

List the actions you took in implementing the Lab Module:

1) installed Python 3.13 and VS Code. 

2) cloned the `ipp-excercise-components` repository and set PYTHONPATH.

3) created Python modules and ran them to check output.


### Unit and/or Integration Tests Executed

List the tests you exercised in validating your functionality for the Lab Module:

1) Ran `SimpleStrings.py` and confirmed the f-string output.

2) Ran `SimplePlatformInfo.py` and confirmed system name and machine type were displayed. 

3) Ran `SimpleSystemInfo.py` and confirmed Python version string and `sys.version_info` data structure were displayed.
